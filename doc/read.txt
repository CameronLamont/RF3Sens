It is necessary to connect hardware FastPwm, tk. I soldered the sensor on a tink, then I clean only the digispark option.
This is where the hard hack begins. By default, the PWM frequency on douins is only about 500Hz. For digispark googled:

T.e. in my case I have to do:
-a) added a modification to allow high speed hardware PWM on Pin0 (up to 32.2KHz), 1 (up to 64.5KHz) and 4 (up to 64.5KHz) without breaking micros (), millis (), delay () and without disturbing DigiUSB. FAVOR_PHASE_CORRECT_PWM shall be set to 0 in core_build_option.h, otherwise Pin1 can only reach 32.2KHz and not 64.5KHz.
